Carte Noire is designed to start each article with an all-white image as a
thumbnail. These are created by adding a `thumbnail` parameter to the article's
[YAML frontmatter][1]. This thumbnail parameter is processed in one of two ways,
images specified in `_data/thumbnails.yml` or using [Font Awesome][2].

## Some background on progress so far

I’ve played around with nodejs express and react technologies and have some idea on the JavaScript scene. I’ve followed some courses in udemy on React and React native technologies and tried building some stuff as side projects.
