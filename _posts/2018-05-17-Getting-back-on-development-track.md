## Some background on progress so far

I’ve played around with nodejs express and react technologies and have some idea on the JavaScript scene. I’ve followed some courses in udemy on React and React native technologies and tried building some stuff as side projects.

Some side projects I work on these days are TimeApp and AthalBot. TimeApp is and React Native application where I try to replicate [this](http://tiii.me/)  (as much as I can). AthalBot is a facebookBot that returns gags from 9gag and it is integrated with dialog flow for nlp processing.
