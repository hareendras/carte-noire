This is Part II of getting back on development track posts where I try to record my progress and interesting tools and problems and solutions I come across.

So in last post we had some progress on getting jekyll site up and running using docker. We were able to generate new Jekyll site using Jekyll new command. Letâ€™s work on getting this site up and running.


Aww snap!!

This error was resolved after restarting docker from the task bar icon. And now as usual to the next error. ðŸ˜‰

Got rid of this error. The reason was my gem directory was in the same folder as my site root. Explicitly excluding in _config.yml resolved the error. [more info](http://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/invalid-date-error-using-bundle-exec-jekyll-serve-vendor-not-working/538/3)
```yml
exclude:
# - Gemfile
# - Gemfile.lock
# - node_modules
# - vendor/bundle/
# - vendor/cache/
# - vendor/gems/
# - vendor/ruby/
# - vendor
 - gems

```

Try again...

Looks like it is a good time to try some alternative way of getting this up and running locally. So instead of trying with docker-compose, letâ€™s try to run the container using docker run.
```terminal
docker run -it -v C:/Users/hareendras/myblog:/srv/jekyll -v C:/Users/hareendras/myblog:/usr/local/bundle jekyll/jekyll jekyll new .
```
Above command creates a new Jekyll site in current directory of the container.  -v means <sourcepath in my c drive>:<destination path in container> source path is the local path in my laptop and mount path is in container. To use volumes like this, the sharing should be enabled in docker settings.

Create site.

![ImgList](/assets/img/2018-05-18/create.png){:class="img-responsive"}

run it

```terminal
$>  docker run -it -p 4000:4000 -v C:/Users/hareendras/myblog:/srv/jekyll -v C:/Users/hareendras/myblog:/usr/local/bundle jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve
```
Wohoo!! Look ma!! Iâ€™m running Jekyll inside my docker container and brought up the site. Yapee!!
