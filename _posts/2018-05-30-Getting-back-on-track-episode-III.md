This is Part III of getting back on development track posts where I try to record my progress and interesting tools and problems and solutions I come across.

Now we have our Jekyll site up and running in local using docker container and therefore we can continue creating posts locally and publish it in github pages using git commit. To create new posts, all we need to do is create files under _posts folder and the file name should be yyyy-mm-dd-<post title>.md format
